# Project Functionality Test Plan

## Setup Requirements

1. **Database**: Ensure the existing `projects` table has a `created_by` field
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set

## Test Cases

### 1. User Authentication
- [ ] User can sign up/login
- [ ] User profile is created in the `users` table
- [ ] User can access the dashboard

### 2. Project Creation
- [ ] User can click "+ Project" in the Projects menu
- [ ] Create Project dialog opens
- [ ] User can enter project name and description
- [ ] Project is created successfully with `created_by` field set
- [ ] Project appears in the Projects menu
- [ ] Project becomes the active project

### 3. Project Display
- [ ] Projects menu shows all projects created by the user
- [ ] Projects are displayed in chronological order (newest first)
- [ ] Project selection works correctly
- [ ] Active project is visually indicated

### 4. Database Integration
- [ ] Projects are stored in the `projects` table
- [ ] `created_by` field correctly links to the user's ID
- [ ] Users can only see projects they have created
- [ ] Project data includes name, description, status, and timestamps

### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Proper error messages are displayed for failed project creation
- [ ] Form validation works correctly
- [ ] Loading states are properly managed

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start the application**: `npm run dev`
2. **Sign up/login** with a test account
3. **Navigate to Projects** in the sidebar
4. **Click "+ Project"** to create a new project
5. **Fill in project details** and submit
6. **Verify the project appears** in the Projects menu
7. **Click on the project** to select it
8. **Check the database** to verify the project was created with correct `created_by` field

## Expected Database State

After creating a project, you should see:

1. **projects table**: New record with:
   - `id`: Unique project ID
   - `name`: Project name
   - `description`: Project description (if provided)
   - `status`: 'active'
   - `created_by`: User's ID
   - `created_at`: Timestamp

## Troubleshooting

- If projects don't appear, check the browser console for errors
- If database errors occur, verify the `projects` table has the correct structure
- If authentication errors occur, check that the user is properly logged in
