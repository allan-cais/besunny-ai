# Multi-Service Railway Deployment

## 🎯 **New Approach: Single Multi-Service Config**

Instead of separate config files, we're now using a single `railway.toml` file that explicitly defines both services. This should override any cached configuration.

## 📋 **What We've Created**

### **Single `railway.toml` File:**
- **Frontend Service:** Explicitly defined with Node.js build
- **Backend Service:** Explicitly defined with Python build
- **No ambiguity:** Railway knows exactly what each service should do

## 🚀 **How to Deploy**

### **1. Commit and Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway: Use multi-service railway.toml configuration"
git push origin main
```

### **2. Railway Will Auto-Deploy:**
- Railway reads the new `railway.toml`
- Creates two services: `frontend` and `backend`
- Each service uses its specific build configuration

## 🔧 **Service Configuration**

### **Frontend Service:**
- **Name:** `frontend`
- **Build Command:** `npm install && npm run build:production`
- **Start Command:** `npx serve -s dist -l $PORT`
- **Technology:** Node.js (explicitly forced)

### **Backend Service:**
- **Name:** `backend`
- **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command:** `cd backend && python start.py`
- **Technology:** Python (explicitly forced)

## ✅ **Why This Should Work**

1. **Single Source of Truth:** One `railway.toml` file
2. **Explicit Service Definition:** No ambiguity about what each service does
3. **Forced Technology Detection:** Node.js vs Python explicitly set
4. **No Cached Configuration:** This file should override any defaults

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After pushing to GitHub:
1. **Railway creates two services** from the single config
2. **Frontend builds with Node.js** (`npm install && npm run build:production`)
3. **Backend builds with Python** (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. **No more shared builder issues**
5. **Each service runs independently**

## 🔍 **If This Still Doesn't Work**

The issue might be deeper in Railway's system. In that case:
1. **Check Railway dashboard** for any project-level settings
2. **Verify the new `railway.toml`** is being read
3. **Consider creating completely new Railway projects**
4. **Contact Railway support** about cached configuration issues

## 💡 **Key Takeaway**

By using a single multi-service configuration file, we're giving Railway explicit instructions about how to build and run each service. This should eliminate the shared builder issue and ensure each service uses the correct technology stack.
