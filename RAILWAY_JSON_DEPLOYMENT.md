# Railway JSON Deployment Guide

## üéØ **New Approach: Using railway.json**

Since Railway was ignoring our `railway.toml` configuration, we're now using Railway's newer `railway.json` format which should be more reliable for multi-service deployments.

## üìã **What We've Created**

### **railway.json Configuration:**
- **Frontend Service:** Explicitly defined with Node.js build
- **Backend Service:** Explicitly defined with Python build
- **Environment-specific:** Uses production environment configuration
- **JSON Schema:** Follows Railway's official schema

## üöÄ **How to Deploy**

### **1. Commit and Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway: Use railway.json multi-service configuration"
git push origin main
```

### **2. Railway Will Auto-Deploy:**
- Railway reads the new `railway.json`
- Creates two services: `frontend` and `backend`
- Each service uses its specific build configuration

## üîß **Service Configuration**

### **Frontend Service:**
- **Name:** `frontend`
- **Build Command:** `npm install && npm run build:production`
- **Start Command:** `npx serve -s dist -l $PORT`
- **Technology:** Node.js (explicitly forced)
- **Output Directory:** `dist/`

### **Backend Service:**
- **Name:** `backend`
- **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command:** `cd backend && python start.py`
- **Technology:** Python (explicitly forced)

## ‚úÖ **Why This Should Work**

1. **Official JSON Schema:** Uses Railway's documented format
2. **Environment-specific:** Clear production environment configuration
3. **Explicit Service Definition:** No ambiguity about what each service does
4. **Forced Technology Detection:** Node.js vs Python explicitly set
5. **No Cached Configuration:** This file should override any defaults

## üéØ **Expected Result**

After pushing to GitHub:
1. **Railway creates two services** from the JSON config
2. **Frontend builds with Node.js** (`npm install && npm run build:production`)
3. **Backend builds with Python** (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. **No more shared builder issues**
5. **Each service runs independently**

## üîç **Key Differences from Previous Approach**

- **Format:** `railway.json` instead of `railway.toml`
- **Schema:** Follows Railway's official JSON schema
- **Environment:** Explicit production environment configuration
- **Structure:** More standardized multi-service definition

## üí° **Key Takeaway**

By using Railway's official JSON schema format, we're ensuring that Railway properly recognizes and applies our multi-service configuration. This should finally solve the shared builder issue and ensure each service uses the correct technology stack.
